                I have a quick question for you...
                <br><br>
                Have you ever wondered what it would be like to be a walking weather 
                encyclopedia? No? Shocking. I mean, who wouldn't want to know every 
                possible detail about the temperature, humidity, wind speed, and cloud
                 formations around them? It's not like anyone has anything better to do 
                 with their time. And for those who only care about the basics like 
                 "is it raining" or "do I need a coat," don't worry - I've got you covered 
                 with a deluge of utterly useless information. Because, let's face it, who 
                 needs to know about the finer points of atmospheric pressure unless you're, 
                 I don't know, a meteorologist or something? So, to all you weather experts 
                 out there, you're welcome. For the rest of us, well, at least we know 
                 how to make small talk about the weather.

            Information overload is a symptom of our desire to not focus on what is important. It is a choice. The
            problem is too much information.
            Everyone is distracted with conflicting versions of ever increasingly complex events. Much like the
            weather.<br>-Unknown reason why this was ever written
