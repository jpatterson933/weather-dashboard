# Application Description

This application can be used to find the current weather data and five day forecast of any known city typed into the search bar. The user can find weather data on the current temperature, wind speeds, uv index and relevant color for uvi level, current conditions with associated image, and the humidity levels for the city. The five day forecast will display the same information except instead of the current temperature, it will take the max and minimum temperature of the day and display it for the user to read.

The user can also save a city and easily return and load the five day forecast for their saved city.
