Use

This application can be used to find the the current weather data and five day forecast of any known city typed into the search bar. Specifically, the user can find weather data on the current temperature, wind speeds, uvi levels and color, current conditions with current condition image, and the humidity levels for the city. The five day forecast will display the same information except instead of the current temperature (as it is in the future), it will take the max and minimum temperature of the day and display it for the user to read.
